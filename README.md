### 1 -Project Description.  

Overall objective of this module is to create a web site,  , that displays a stylized global map showing earthquake activity for the past seven days. 

1. The app offers a control on the top right corner for selecting between three different Mapbox map styles; street, satellite and outdoors, as well as two different overlays; earthquakes and tectonic plates. 
2. Each earthquake is displayed with a circle marker that is color coded by magnitude as shown in the legend on the bottom right corner.  The size of each circle marker is also proportional to the earthquake magnitude.
3. Each earthquake marker has a a popup that displays magnitude and location.
4. Seven day earthquake data is pulled from USGS: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes.
5. Tectonic plate data is pulled from frazen Github site: https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates.
